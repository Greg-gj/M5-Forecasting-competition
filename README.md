\# M5 Forecasting - Accuracy Experiment



\## Project Overview

This repository contains my ongoing work and experiments with the \[Kaggle M5 Forecasting - Accuracy](www.kaggle.com) competition. The goal is to predict 28 days of daily unit sales for Walmart products across various stores and states.



\## The Challenge \& Experimentation

Unlike standard forecasting, the M5 dataset presents unique challenges that I am exploring:

\- \*\*Intermittent Demand:\*\* Many items have zero sales for long periods.

\- \*\*Hierarchy:\*\* Sales must be forecasted accurately from individual items up to total company turnover.

\- \*\*Scale:\*\* Processing large rows of data requires memory management.



\## Current Status/ Steps

\- \[x] Environment setup

\- \[x] Preliminary Data Loading \& Memory Optimization

\- \[ ] Exploratory Data Analysis - \*In Progress\*

\- \[ ] Feature Engineering Research 

\- \[ ] Model Development 



\## Resources \& Research

I am currently analyzing top-performing solutions from the Kaggle community to compare different modeling approaches (Recursive vs. Non-recursive) and feature selection techniques against my own solutions to understand the differences and to improve my solution.
